American Music Club, one of the most lauded bands of 
the last several years, have returned with the finest 
album of their storied career. Powered by raw emotion 
and alcoholic beverages, "San Francisco" features Mark 
Eitzel's best-ever collection of songs perfectly 
executed by the group, which swings elegantly from 3 
a.m. melancholia to blinding fury. It stands as AMC's 
most accomplished and accessible work.

<p>
The album was produced by Joe Chiccarelli (Seven Day 
Diary, The Verlaines, Steve Wynn). Several tracks were 
mixed by the legendary Bob Clearmountain.

<p>
Over the past few years, American Music Club have 
attracted an immense volume of press coverage so 
unanimous and enthusiastic in its praise of the 
group's accomplishments that it's almost scary. 

<p>
AMC are well-known for their spellbinding live 
performances. They'll be touring extensively this 
fall.

<p>
The CD and cassette versions of the album feature 
two hidden tracks: a reprise of "Fearless" and a cover 
of The Mamas And Papas' "California Dreamin'." The 
limited-edition vinyl version features a revised 
lineup (without the hidden tracks and with two fewer 
songs) that includes the otherwise unavailable track 
"I Just Took My Two Sleeping Pills And Now I'm Like A 
Bridegroom Standing At The Altar."
