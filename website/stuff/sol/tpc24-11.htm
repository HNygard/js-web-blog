<P>
Slash presents the debut of Soul Coughing, a genre-smashing,
boundary-trespassing cubist bebop beat combo from New York whose debut
album is destined to encroach severely on your personal listening
space. A word to the wise guy: "Ruby Vroom" is straight from
Coolsville, dad.
</P>

<P>
What is Soul Coughing? Funky drums. Acoustic bass.
Skittery guitar. Surreal post-Ken Nordine-style verbiage. And a
real-time sampler player dishing up everything from squeaking doors to
answering machine messages to Raymond Scott.
</P>

<P>
The album was produced by Tchad Blake (Tom Waits, Latin Playboys,
Elvis Costello).
</P>

<P>
How They Got Their Name: Singer M. Doughty wrote a bad poem about Neil Young
throwing up. The title stuck.
