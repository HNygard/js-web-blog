"These songs just up and walked out of the woods," 
says Grant Lee Phillips of his band's new album. "And 
I can't say whether they're vegetable or mineral, 
'cause when you bite into one of these things, you 
might get a mouthful of bones or a mouthful of notes."

<p>
Last year, <i>Fuzzy</i> -one of the most critically 
raved-about albums of the year - introduced listeners 
to the cryptic anthems of L.A.'s Grant Lee Buffalo. 
<i>Mighty Joe Moon,</i> the group's second effort, is even 
better - a brilliant tangle of hypnotic strumming and 
lyrical images that explode like cherrybombs.

<p>
Grant Lee Phillips writes the songs, sings and plays 
various instruments with strings. Paul Kimble plays 
bass and keyboards, as well as producing. Joey Peters 
bangs on stuff. "If there are still hellhounds abroad 
in America," says England's Q magazine, "these boys 
sound like they have them on their tails."

<p>
Look for  awesome live performances (their version of Elvis' 
"Burning Love" must be experienced to be believed) to 
expand Grant Lee Buffalo's audience dramatically this year. 
[We hear that the band will probably be doing shows next 
year with a very popular group who haven't toured in 
five years and whose new album is a monster. You 
figure it out.]
