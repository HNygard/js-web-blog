<h1><img src="nclbul.gif"> S/S Norway</h1>


Born the S/S France, there has never been another ship like her, and there will never be again. She is as long as the Eiffel tower is tall, and ever since her introduction, has been hailed for her plush splendor, architectural marvels, exquisite cuisine, and priceless art collection. And after the finishing touches of a $60 million refurbishment, the Norway is young again!<br>
