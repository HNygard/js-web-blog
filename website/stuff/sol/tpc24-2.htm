With "Bright Red," her first album in five years, 
Laurie Anderson returns to the essential core of her 
art. With its stripped-down sound (courtesy of producer 
Brian Eno) and its emphasis on the spoken word, the 
album is a showcase for Anderson's voice and her 
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"And what I really want to know is/Are things 
getting better/Or are they getting worse? Can we start 
all over again?" Those questions are at the center of 
the material on "Bright Red," which reaffirms 
Anderson's position as one of our sharpest 
commentators on the human condition. By turns funny 
and serious, playful and elegiac, the album is a set 
of mirrors held up to all of our lives.
</p>

<p>
In addition to Eno's sonic contributions, the album 
features performances by Adrian Belew, Marc Ribot and 
Arto Lindsay. Lou Reed co-wrote, played guitar and 
contributed vocals to one track.
</p>

<p>
Laurie has recently completed a reading tour in 
support of her new book, "Stories From The Nerve 
Bible." She'll be touring with a full-fledged 
performance featuring material from "Bright Red" in 
the upcoming months.
</p>

<p>
Expect extensive press coverage surrounding this 
release. A recent Wired cover story has already 
provided a glimpse into the making of this album. 
Videos are also forthcoming.
