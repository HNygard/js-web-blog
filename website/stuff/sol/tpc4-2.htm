<h1>SERIES OF UNSOLVED BOMBINGS</h1>
<hr>

   Beginning in May, 1978, a series of bombing incidents have
occurred across the United States for which there is no apparent
explanation or motive.  No person or group has been identified as the
perpetrator(s) of these incidents.  The explosions have taken place in
eight states from Connecticut to California.  As a result of these
bombings, two individuals have been killed and 23 others injured, some
grievously.  No incidents associated with this series of bombings were
identified between 1987 and 1993.  That changed in late June, 1993,
when a well known geneticist residing in Tiburon, California, and a
renown computer scientist from Yale University, New Haven,
Connecticut, opened packages which had been mailed to them and both
were severely injured when these packages exploded.  Eighteen months
later an advertising executive was killed at his home in North
Caldwell, New Jersey.  The latest bombing was the work of the same
perpetrators(s).<p>
