<h4>Medium</h4>I wanted a blog. A plain and simple blog. More often than not I read blog posts hosted by <a href="https://medium.com/">medium.com</a>. It seems like they are really dominating these days (at least for tech blogs). And I understand why; the layout is so simple yet attractive and easy to read.
                
I expected to settle with a medium.com blog. However, it isn't possible to have ads in the blog posts. And I wanted that.

<h4>Wordpress</h4>Wordpress has ruled the world for quite a long time. <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> of course costs money if you want to make any money using ads. I don't expect many dollars in income, so I'd like to avoid any fixed costs. Then there is <a href="https://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>, but I don't really want to host it myself and stay up to date with <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/4096/Wordpress-Wordpress.html">security issues</a> and all.

<h4>Blogger</h4>I looked at Google's <a href="https://blogger.com">blogger.com</a>. Customizing the layout and templates I thought I was getting there. They have some really nice features. But I couldn't make it look and feel exactly right. And it felt cumbersome to do all the adjustments to get where I wanted.

<h4>Good old days</h4>I knew I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. If this had been somewhere from 2000 to 2007 I probably would have mashed something together using PHP and MySQL. But the thought of doing that in 2017 repelled me. I didn't want any database setup, SQLs or stuff that takes time from creating the actual product.

<h4>Cloud hosting</h4>Further on I didn't want some hosting at one of the big companies offering "free" (they tend to end up costing a few bucks) backend hosting with all the hassle of setting up a new environment and installing some SDKs that needs to be constantly updated or suddenly removes support for some version of whatever you use.

<h4>Requirements</h4>Basically I had the following requirements.
<ul><li> - High readability and ok design</li><li> - Ad support</li><li> - Simple hosting</li><li> - Easy, but advanced customization</li><li> - Quick to set up with no hassle (no database setup, easy development, no unecessary heavy build systems)</li><li> - SEO friendly</li></ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>I was wondering about using just static HTML files. That would indeed answer most of my requirements. But then I thought about having a simple JavaScript SPA.

<h5>JavaScript framework</h5>I suppose <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> or <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> would be among the most logical choices of JavaScript frameworks in 2017. But I wanted productivity and not use a lot of time to learn yet another framework when all I want is a quick and simple blog, so I went for good old <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> which I have used quite a lot as earlier on as an IT consultant.

<img class="materialboxed responsive-img" title="Knockout js dead? Not the Google auto completion you want." data-caption="Knockout js dead? Not the Google auto completion you want." alt="Is Knockout JS dead?" src="https://rawgit.com/roys/js-web-blog/master/images/knockout-js_dead.png">

While one might argue that Knockout is beyond its prime time, it sure works great and it is mature. And no matter which newer JavaScript framework I would go for it would soon be considered "old". If you haven't read the article <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f">How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016</a> by Jose Aguinaga, you really should. It's painful to read, but so true.

<h5>Design</h5>I'm no designer. So I like to use UI frameworks that ensures that I can't get it completely wrong. I really like Google's <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/">Material Design</a> and is used to using it on Android. I quickly found <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize</a> and haven't looked back. It has great features and is a joy to use. I just wish it didn't depend on jQuery.

                text: `<h4>tldr;</h4>Over the years I've discovered so many security holes and information leaks on the Internet. Earlier I've only notified the involved parties, but I think it's time to go public doing "responsible disclosure".
                
<h4>The purpose</h4>Working with preparing these posts I've asked myself repeatedly if I should go public with my findings or not.

I'm still not entirely sure what the right answer is. What I do know is that <b>I want increased focus on web security</b> and that I feel a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_responsibility">social responsibility</a> to do so.

The purpose of posting these vulnerabilities is fivefold:
 - Make people aware that close to all their personal information is already in the hands of anyone who wants it.
 - I want computer security to be a (bigger) part of the IT education and training.
 - I want computer security to be a natural part of any developer's mindset.
 - I want businesses to know that there might be consequences of being sloppy with people's data.
 - Make your and my own data more safe.

<b>Hopefully the issues presented on this site can be a small part of getting some kind of discussion on how to deal with computer security and personal data.</b>

<h4>What I have done</h4>While looking for security vulnerabilities I have followed a few simple rules.

<h5>What I have done:</h5> - Only looked at webapps (frontends and APIs) and mobile apps
 - Only looked at Norwegian services (though some are internationally available)
 - Immediately reported any security concerns and given reasonably time to fix any problems
 - Only spent minutes until I found some security hole or information leak

<h5>What I have not done:</h5> - Not hid my identity:
   - I have worked from my home IP
   - When logged in I have used my own personal account
   - I have not tried to fly under the radar in regards of staying out of logs etc.
 - Not looked for or used security holes in operating systems, app servers, networking equipment, etc.
 - Not interferred with the operation of the webapps or companies
 - Not altered or deleted any data
 - Not stored any personal data or even tried accessing anything beyond proving the weakness

<h4>Information sensitivity</h4>The levels of the sensitivity in the information leaks I found vary. They go all the way from <i>"Nah, I dont really care"</i> to <i>"0hly shit, this is not cool"</i>. But I think they all represent some unique points in respect of vulnerabilities and in respect of type of personal information.

<h4>Reponsible disclosure</h4>I'm all for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsible disclosure</a> and have immediately reported my findings. Generally I'm not publishing any details the problem has been confirmed fixed. However, sadly, in some cases there's just no interest or response from the other party.

If you want more thoughts about responsible disclosure I would recommand reading <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/kids-pass-just-reminded-us-how-hard-responsible-disclosure-is/">Troy Hunt's site</a> (and maybe especially the video in that link).
