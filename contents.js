<h4>Medium</h4>I wanted a blog. A plain and simple blog. More often than not I read blog posts hosted by <a href="https://medium.com/">medium.com</a>. It seems like they are really dominating these days (at least for tech blogs). And I understand why; the layout is so simple yet attractive and easy to read.
                
I expected to settle with a medium.com blog. However, it isn't possible to have ads in the blog posts. And I wanted that.

<h4>Wordpress</h4>Wordpress has ruled the world for quite a long time. <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> of course costs money if you want to make any money using ads. I don't expect many dollars in income, so I'd like to avoid any fixed costs. Then there is <a href="https://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>, but I don't really want to host it myself and stay up to date with <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/4096/Wordpress-Wordpress.html">security issues</a> and all.

<h4>Blogger</h4>I looked at Google's <a href="https://blogger.com">blogger.com</a>. Customizing the layout and templates I thought I was getting there. They have some really nice features. But I couldn't make it look and feel exactly right. And it felt cumbersome to do all the adjustments to get where I wanted.

<h4>Good old days</h4>I knew I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. If this had been somewhere from 2000 to 2007 I probably would have mashed something together using PHP and MySQL. But the thought of doing that in 2017 repelled me. I didn't want any database setup, SQLs or stuff that takes time from creating the actual product.

<h4>Cloud hosting</h4>Further on I didn't want some hosting at one of the big companies offering "free" (they tend to end up costing a few bucks) backend hosting with all the hassle of setting up a new environment and installing some SDKs that needs to be constantly updated or suddenly removes support for some version of whatever you use.

<h4>Requirements</h4>Basically I had the following requirements.
<ul><li> - High readability and ok design</li><li> - Ad support</li><li> - Simple hosting</li><li> - Easy, but advanced customization</li><li> - Quick to set up with no hassle (no database setup, easy development, no unecessary heavy build systems)</li><li> - SEO friendly</li></ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>I was wondering about using just static HTML files. That would indeed answer most of my requirements. But then I thought about having a simple JavaScript SPA.

<h5>JavaScript framework</h5>I suppose <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> or <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> would be among the most logical choices of JavaScript frameworks in 2017. But I wanted productivity and not use a lot of time to learn yet another framework when all I want is a quick and simple blog, so I went for good old <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> which I have used quite a lot as earlier on as an IT consultant.

<img class="materialboxed responsive-img" title="Knockout js dead? Not the Google auto completion you want." data-caption="Knockout js dead? Not the Google auto completion you want." alt="Is Knockout JS dead?" src="https://rawgit.com/roys/js-web-blog/master/images/knockout-js_dead.png">

While one might argue that Knockout is beyond its prime time, it sure works great and it is mature. And no matter which newer JavaScript framework I would go for it would soon be considered "old". If you haven't read the article <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f">How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016</a> by Jose Aguinaga, you really should. It's painful to read, but so true.

<h5>Design</h5>I'm no designer. So I like to use UI frameworks that ensures that I can't get it completely wrong. I really like Google's <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/">Material Design</a> and is used to using it on Android. I quickly found <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize</a> and haven't looked back. It has great features and is a joy to use. I just wish it didn't depend on jQuery.
