In the two years since their debut, Little Texas 
have emerged as one of the biggest groups in country 
music. Their first album went gold. Their second album 
went platinum. They've scored a series of hit singles 
including <i>What Might Have Been,</i> <i>God Blessed Texas</i>
and the crossover smash <i>My Love.</i> And they recently 
won the 1994 ACM award for Top Vocal Group.

<p>
Little Texas's third album is destined to keep the 
group's winning streak intact. It showcases the band's 
increasing artistic maturity and finds their 
exceptional songwriting and vocal talents at their 
peak.

<p>
The album was produced by the band along with 
Christy DiNapoli and Doug Grau, who also co-produced 
last year's <b>Big Time</b>.

<p>
Little Texas will be touring steadily over the next 
several months. They'll take to the road in mid-
October with Tim McGraw and Blackhawk. In February, 
they'll tour with Reba McEntire.

<p>
The band release their first home video this month. 
It features clips for every one of their singles 
(including <i>Kick A Little</i>) as well as exclusive new 
footage.
