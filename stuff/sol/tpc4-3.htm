<h1>A Message to the Users of the Internet</h1>

Dear Netters:<p>

The information about the UNABOM investigation has previously been
made public.  Recent print media accounts include: <b>New York
Times</b> (12/12/94), <b>San Francisco Examiner</b> (12/12/94), <b>San
Jose Mercury News</b> (12/12/94), etc.<p>

Earlier media accounts were presented on CBS's <b>"Eye to Eye" with
Connie Chung</b> (12/16/93), and Fox's <b>"America's Most Wanted"</b>
(11/23/93).  Newspaper stores about UNABOM have also appeared: <b>
Washington Post</b> (11/27/93), <b>New York Times</b> (10/7/93),
etc.<p>
  
        The purpose for submitting the information on the Internet is two-fold.
First, the Internet is another medium that enables us to reach as wide an
audience as possible; to "spread the word."  Second, Internet users are
precisely the type of individuals that to date have been recipients of
explosive devices attributed to UNABOM; scholars and researchers.<p>
 
        You are not being asked to place yourself in harm's way.  You are
encouraged to come forward if you have information that might help identify,
arrest, and convict the person(s) responsible for these bombings.  Contact the
UNABOM Task Force at 1-800-701-2662.<p>
 
Thank you,
