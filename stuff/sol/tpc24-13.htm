Karyn White's third album follows a string of hits 
(including <i>Superwoman</i> and <i>Romantic</i>) that have 
brought her to multi-platinum stardom and established 
her as one of the most impressive vocalists working 
today. "I feel great about it," she says of <b>Make Him 
Do Right</b>. "I've had a two-year hiatus to have a baby-
now I'm back."

<p>
The new album was recorded with some of the hottest 
producers in the world. The bulk of the album was 
recorded with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson). 
Also included are two tracks cut with Babyface and one 
with Daryl Simmons. Modern pop doesn't get any better-
crafted than this.

<p>
The song titles on <b>Make Him Do Right</b> suggest real-life
contradictions: <i>Here Comes The Pain Again,</i>
<i>Weakness</i> and <i>Hungah</i> at one end; <i>Simple Pleasure,</i>
<i>I'm Your Woman</i> and <i>Thinkin' 'Bout Love</i> at the 
other. "My songs," says the diva, "become hits because 
they're real."
