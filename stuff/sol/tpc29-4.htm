<H1>Elizabeth I of England</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
Elizabeth I was queen of England from 1558 to 1603. Though her small kingdom
was threatened by grave internal divisions, Elizabeth's blend
of shrewdness, courage, and majestic self-display inspired ardent
expressions of loyalty and helped unify the nation against foreign
enemies. The adulation bestowed upon her both in her lifetime
and in the ensuing centuries was not altogether a spontaneous
effusion; it was the result of a carefully crafted, brilliantly
executed campaign in which the queen fashioned herself as the
glittering symbol of the nation's destiny. This political symbolism,
common to monarchies, had more substance than usual, for the
queen was by no means a mere figurehead. While she did not wield
the absolute power of which Renaissance rulers dreamed, she
tenaciously upheld her authority to make critical decisions
and to set the central policies of both state and church. The
latter half of the 16th century in England is justly called
the <b>Elizabethan</b> era: rarely has the collective life of a whole
<b>age</b> been given so distinctively personal a stamp. <P>
