Tom Petty makes his long-awaited Warner Bros. debut 
with Wildflowers, a vast and eclectic album that's one 
of the finest works of this veteran rocker's career.

<p>
Continuing the collaboration with producer Rick 
Rubin that resulted in the huge success of "Mary 
Jane's Last Dance," Tom has fashioned an album with a 
clean, stripped-down sound that embraces everything 
from tough rockers to spiky power-pop, from epic songs 
of social comment to passionate ballads. Several songs 
feature orchestral arrangements by Michael Kamen.

<p>
Joining Tom on this album are Heartbreakers 
stalwarts Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench and Howie 
Epstein. Steve Ferrone drums on most of the album, 
with some guy named Ringo laying down the beat on one 
track. Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys contributes 
vocals on one track.
