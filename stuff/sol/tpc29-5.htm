<H2>World Affairs: United Nations</H2>
Calls on the United Nations for more peacekeeping forces rose dramatically, and some of the troops were authorized, for the first time, to enforce order, not just monitor peace agreements. The UN's estimated expenditures rose to $3.6 billion, but where the funds would come from remained a mystery. "Demands made upon the United Nations are not being matched by resources to do the job," said Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. A Ford Foundation panel
suggested in February that governments charge peacekeeping costs to national military budgets and authorize the UN to charge interest on arrears. (<I>See </I>MILITARY AFFAIRS.)
