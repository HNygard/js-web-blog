(b. July 7, 1887, Vitebsk, Russia--d. March 28, 1985, Saint-Paul,
Alpes-Maritimes, Fr.)
<br>
Russian-born painter, printmaker, and designer whose works combine
images from personal experience with formal symbolic and aesthetic
elements by virtue of their inner poetic force, rather than by rules
of pictorial logic. Preceding <a href="tpc-0.htm">Surrealism</a>,
his early works, such as
<cite>I and the Village</cite> (1911),
were among the first expressions of psychic
reality in modern art. His works in various mediums include sets for
plays and ballets, etchings illustrating the Bible, and stained-glass
windows.
