<h1>Description of the UNABOM Crimes</h1>

   In the past, targets of the bomber have been associated with the
computer industry, the aircraft and airline industry and universities.
Eight of these devices have been mailed to specific individuals and
the other seven have been placed in locations which suggest there was
no specific intended victim.  All but two of the explosive devices
functioned as designed and exploded.  All 15 crimes, dubbed "UNABOM",
have had common effects: all have caused terror, grief, and fear.  On
September 11, 1985, Hugh Scrutton, the owner of the Rentech Computer
Company, in Sacramento, California, was killed by one of these
diabolic devices.  The two 1993 victims narrowly escaped death.  On
December 10, 1994, advertising executive Thomas Mosser was killed when
a package mailed to his home exploded when he opened the package.

   In response to the June, 1993, events, the Attorney General 
directed that a task force of federal law enforcement agencies be 
reestablished to urgently investigate and solve these crimes. The 
UNABOM Task Force, consisting of investigators from the FBI, ATF, 
and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, has been operational in 
San Francisco and Sacramento, California, since July 12, 1993, and 
is dedicated exclusively to the investigation of these crimes.

   Among the clues in the case are the following words in what 
appears to be a note possibly written by the bomber as a reminder 
to make a telephone call:  "call Nathan R--Wed 7PM."  The UNABOM 
Task Force believes that "Nathan R" may be associated, perhaps 
innocently, with the bomber and that "Nathan R" may have received 
a telephone call from the bomber on a Wednesday prior to the June, 
1993 bombings.
<p>
   The three most recent tragic bombings illustrate the senseless 
and tragic consequences of these crimes and demonstrate the urgent 
necessity of solving this case.  This serial bomber will strike 
again.  We do not know who the next victim will be.  We do believe 
that there is someone out there who can provide the identity of 
the person or persons responsible for these crimes. This person 
may be a friend, a neighbor, or even a relative of the bomber(s).
