For their follow-up to "Automatic For The People," 
R.E.M. have put away their acoustic instruments, 
plugged in their amps and made a no-holds-barred rock 
'n' roll record. Monster, "Bill Berry" declares, is 
"bold and in your face." Michael Stipe says simply, 
"it's much louder."<p>

"Monster" is the fifth consecutive album the band 
have recorded with producer Scott Litt. Though the 
volume may indeed be greater, it's as melodically rich 
and sonically ambitious as any music R.E.M. have ever 
made.<p>

"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?" looks likely to be 
the first single and video. <p>
Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore makes a cameo 
appearance on one track, "Crush With Eyeliner."<p>

A special limited CD edition of the album is 
available. It's housed in a 52-page book (with red and 
silver cover) containing exclusive photos and art. 
Just 20,000 copies are available. "Monster" is also 
available on vinyl.
